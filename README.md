# Physical Lab v0.10.0 — Reproducible Computational Physics & Engineering for macOS

[![Source Integrity](https://github.com/lord-navy-crypto/Physical-Lab-v0.4.1/actions/workflows/source-integrity.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lord-navy-crypto/Physical-Lab-v0.4.1/actions/workflows/source-integrity.yml)

**Physical Lab is a native macOS Evidence-First Engineering Systems Workbench that turns ten computational-physics and engineering model families into one reproducible workflow: model / measurement → evidence → engineering decision → operations → quality / reliability → risk / economics → requirements / verification → human review.**

It combines numerical-error analysis, Monte Carlo/statistical physics, stochastic simulation, nonlinear dynamics, oscillation/integration, and a RADIA-backed **magnet → electron trajectory → radiation** workflow. Physical Lab adds the engineering and research-software layer around those solvers: isolated environments, pinned source revisions, Safe/Full execution, scientific smoke tests, measurement provenance, V&V/UQ, model-specific requirement scorecards, automated refinement/replicate campaigns, convergence/cost analysis, robust-design summaries, measured/model comparison, batch planning, run provenance, and reproducibility exports.

The **Unreleased Research Model Builder MVP** adds a creator path alongside the ten built-in Lab families: a trusted local `.py` model can be statically inspected without execution, converted into a human-reviewed `ModelSpec`, wrapped by a generated adapter, previewed through deterministic controls/plots, checked for original↔adapter interface equivalence, and stored as a provenance-tracked model bundle inside a canonical `.physlab` Project.

## Introduction

Engineering Lab is a desktop computational engineering and physics platform designed to connect physical models, numerical simulation, experimental data, and engineering analysis in one local environment.

The project began as a collection of separate physics and engineering tools, but gradually developed into a unified laboratory system. Instead of treating simulation as a single “run and view the graph” process, Engineering Lab is designed around a complete workflow: define a physical system, adjust meaningful parameters, run numerical models, inspect results, compare predictions with measurements, test sensitivity and uncertainty, and determine what should be changed next.

The platform includes tools for electromagnetic systems, particle motion, radiation and undulator modeling, orbital and dynamical systems, lattice physics, U-tube experiments, signal analysis, model comparison, visualization, and engineering decision support. Many experiments provide both simplified and advanced controls so users can move from basic exploration toward deeper quantitative analysis.

A major goal of the project is to preserve the connection between equations and engineering decisions. Parameters are not included only for display; wherever possible, users can change physically meaningful quantities and observe how those choices affect the behavior of the system. The platform also includes analysis tools for sensitivity, uncertainty, validation, comparison, diagnostics, and reproducibility.

Engineering Lab is built as a local desktop application using Tauri, Rust, Python, JavaScript, and scientific-computing tools. It is designed to keep the scientific workflow accessible while still exposing the deeper mathematical and engineering structure behind each model.

At its core, Engineering Lab turns computational physics into an interactive engineering workspace: not only asking **“What does the model predict?”**, but also **“Why did the result change, how reliable is it, and what should we modify next?”**

## Research Model Builder — Unreleased MVP

Physical Lab now includes a native **Model Builder** creation surface based on the principle **Preserve the science. Standardize the interface. Automate the bridge.** The MVP is intentionally narrower than an unrestricted AI code generator:

```text
trusted local model.py
        ↓
static AST analysis (no import / no execution)
        ↓
entry / parameters / outputs / dependencies
        ↓
human parameter + unit + range review
        ↓
physical-lab-model-spec-v1
        ↓
adapter.py + deterministic ui.json + tests/provenance
        ↓
explicit trusted local Preview
        ↓
original ↔ adapter equivalence
        ↓
canonical Project models/<bundle-id>/
```

Generation never overwrites the selected source file. A generated bundle contains an `original_model.py` snapshot plus separate `adapter.py`, `model.json`, `ui.json`, `tests.json` and `provenance.json`, each with source/model fingerprints where applicable. Bundle identity includes both source and reviewed-ModelSpec fingerprints, so a changed interface review cannot silently overwrite an earlier bundle made from the same scientific source. Slider bounds are never invented automatically: ranges and scientific units remain human-confirmed metadata.

`Analyze` and `Generate` do not execute the selected model. `Preview` and `Validate Adapter` are separate trusted-local-code actions with a fixed timeout, bounded output capture and no shell-command execution path. The current MVP is **not a sandbox for arbitrary untrusted Internet code** and does not provide public/server Python execution.

Adapter equivalence verifies that the wrapper preserves the selected source snapshot's interface/output structure for a declared test case. It does **not** establish correctness of equations, units, assumptions, numerical method, calibration, experimental validity, safety, compliance or certification. See `docs/RESEARCH_MODEL_BUILDER_MVP.md`.

## Evidence-First Engineering Systems Workbench

Physical Lab now uses one canonical `.physlab` Project state across the physics Labs and the engineering-review layers. The shared Evidence Center contains nine coordinated views:

1. **Credibility Passport** — evidence coverage and graph traceability, without an aggregate credibility score.
2. **Claims** — explicit claim-to-evidence readiness and freshness.
3. **Cross-Checks** — declared method/source comparisons with tolerance and stale-evidence detection.
4. **Engineering Decisions** — constraints, feasibility and Pareto trade studies with human selection rationale.
5. **Operations** — declared resource capacity, task precedence, queue wait, utilization, makespan and dispatch-policy comparison.
6. **Quality & Reliability** — replicate variation, descriptive factor contrasts, specification context and observed event/exposure summaries.
7. **Risk & Economics** — explicit probability × consequence arithmetic and signed cash-flow present-worth calculations.
8. **Requirements & Verification** — normative `shall` requirements, source/upstream trace IDs, test/analysis/inspection/demonstration planning, evidence freshness and human review notes.
9. **Snapshots & Diff** — deterministic evidence snapshots and review-state change detection.

The architecture is deliberately evidence-first rather than score-first. Physical Lab does **not** emit one synthetic engineering score, machine truth verdict, automatic requirement PASS, risk acceptance, process qualification, safety approval, standards-compliance claim, or certification verdict.

The canonical product chain is:

```text
Simulation / Measurement
        ↓
Project Kernel + Measurement Evidence
        ↓
Verification / UQ / Evidence Graph
        ↓
Claims + Cross-Checks + Evidence Freshness
        ↓
Engineering Decisions
        ↓
Operations
        ↓
Quality & Reliability
        ↓
Risk & Economics
        ↓
Requirements & Verification
        ↓
Human Review + Evidence Snapshot / Diff
```

New projects live directly in canonical `projects/*.physlab` stores. The old workspace-alias mechanism has been retired; genuine legacy workspaces remain an explicit compatibility/migration boundary rather than a second active Project system.

See `docs/V010_RELEASE_READINESS.md` plus the individual Engineering Systems layer design notes under `docs/`.

## Ten validated Lab interfaces

1. **Numerical Error Analysis** — Taylor evaluation, cancellation, floating-point reliability, reference comparison and convergence diagnostics.
2. **Ising Monte Carlo Lab** — 1-D/2-D Ising systems, multiple samplers, autocorrelation/ESS, multi-chain diagnostics, finite-size analysis and critical behavior.
3. **Random Walk & Monte Carlo** — random-walk scaling, first-passage/ensemble analysis, Monte Carlo and scrambled Sobol QMC comparisons.
4. **Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos** — driven/double pendula, Lyapunov divergence, stability/flip maps and finite-window chaos diagnostics.
5. **Oscillation & Numerical Integration** — linear/damped/driven/nonlinear oscillators, Euler/Symplectic/RK2/RK4/DOP853 comparisons and energy-work checks.
6. **Kerr Black Hole Geodesics** — strengthened massive/photon Kerr geodesics, Carter-Mino integration, invariant residuals, verification campaigns and frequency-structure refinement.
7. **Sun–Jupiter–Saturn Dynamics** — barycentric orbital dynamics, controlled Newtonian/1PN studies, long-horizon diagnostics, V&V workflow and 5:2 commensurability refinement.
8. **Multilayer Honeycomb Lattice** — reduced-unit multilayer lattice dynamics, stacking/defects/strain, phonon dispersion/DOS and transport refinement.
9. **RADIA Magnet Studio** — 3-D magnet geometry, native RADIA field solving, harmonics, field integrals, trajectory/phase metrics and manufacturing-error ensembles.
10. **Radiation Platform** — magnet-to-trajectory-to-radiation workflow, scan-centric analysis and ideal/reference comparisons.

The seven external Labs and three runtime/builders remain pinned to explicit Git commit revisions in `src-tauri/resources/modules.json`. Kerr, Solar System and Honeycomb are first-class **bundled Labs**: their strengthened solver/UI implementations ship inside the Physical Lab build, while installation creates only an isolated per-Lab environment and a small managed launcher wrapper. They are not duplicated into a second solver checkout.

## v0.9.0 — automated engineering campaigns for all five non-accelerator Labs

v0.8.1 gave the five non-accelerator Labs domain-specific engineering scorecards. v0.9.0 closes the next gap: the scorecard quantities can now be generated by a **bounded automated campaign**, not only entered or assembled manually.

The UI chain is now:

```text
native Lab model
    ↓
automated engineering campaign
    ↓
canonical campaign metrics + deterministic fingerprint
    ↓
Engineering V&V / UQ
    ↓
Engineering Design Workflow
    ↓
model-specific PASS / REVIEW / FAIL scorecard
```

Each campaign has **Compact** and **Standard** presets. Compact is intended for interactive engineering checks. Standard performs a deeper but still bounded study. Campaign output includes the exact configuration, cases, canonical metrics, a deterministic SHA-256 campaign fingerprint, scientific boundary notes, and exportable JSON.

### Numerical Error — automated accuracy / cost refinement

The v0.9 campaign automatically runs multiple Taylor orders over a fixed `[-π, π]` grid and records maximum/RMS error, pass fraction, evaluation count and descriptive runtime. It also runs an independent centered finite-difference refinement to estimate an observed convergence order near two.

The canonical scorecard receives:

- `max_normalized_error`;
- `pass_fraction`;
- `convergence_order`.

Evaluation count is treated as a work proxy and wall-clock runtime remains explicitly machine-dependent.

### Ising Monte Carlo — automated multi-chain diagnostics

The Ising campaign executes independent periodic 2-D Metropolis chains and derives:

- classical between/within-chain R-hat for energy and `|M|`;
- autocorrelation-based effective sample size;
- burn/equilibration drift in sigma units;
- an **exact 4×4 checkpoint** produced by enumerating all `2^16` periodic zero-field states and comparing the Monte Carlo energy per spin at `T = 3.0`.

The canonical scorecard receives `rhat_max`, `effective_samples_min`, `exact_reference_relative_error`, and `equilibration_drift_sigma`. These are finite-sample convergence diagnostics, not proof that a Markov chain has reached the exact target distribution.

### Random Walk / Monte Carlo — automated multi-seed estimator campaign

Independent deterministic seeds run a 2-D unbiased nearest-neighbor walk at multiple step counts. The campaign estimates the log-log MSD exponent, the final `MSD/N` diffusion-scale estimator, and seed-to-seed coefficient of variation.

The theoretical reference is explicit: for this walk, `E[r²] = N`, so the MSD exponent and `MSD/N` targets are both one. The campaign does not generalize that target to arbitrary stochastic processes.

### Nonlinear Dynamics / Chaos — automated finite-window robustness

The Chaos campaign uses the driven Duffing reference

```text
x'' + 0.2 x' - x + x^3 = 0.3 cos(1.2 t)
```

and performs timestep refinement, a finite Poincaré-response indicator, tangent-dynamics finite-time Lyapunov estimation with periodic renormalization, small initial-condition perturbation replicates, and energy/work-balance closure.

It deliberately **does not require long-time trajectories to remain pointwise equal**. The engineering decision is based on convergence of finite-window indicators, Lyapunov-statistic stability, and balance diagnostics rather than treating physical sensitivity to initial conditions as solver failure.

### Oscillation / Integration — automated analytic-reference convergence

The Oscillation campaign integrates a damped linear oscillator with RK4 and compares directly with its closed-form underdamped solution. It automatically derives frequency, amplitude and phase error, viscous energy/work closure, and response change under timestep refinement.

This provides a real analytic-reference V&V path for the numerical solver while preserving the distinction between computational verification and validation of a real mechanical apparatus.

See [`docs/AUTOMATED_MODEL_CAMPAIGNS_V090.md`](docs/AUTOMATED_MODEL_CAMPAIGNS_V090.md).

## v0.8.1 — model-specific engineering across the other five Labs

v0.8.0 established a shared Engineering Design Workflow. v0.8.1 closes the maturity gap between the accelerator path and the five non-accelerator models by adding a **domain-specific engineering layer** rather than forcing every model into the same generic template.

Each supported Lab receives three common decision views:

- **Domain scorecard** — editable lower/upper targets with PASS / REVIEW / FAIL uncertainty-margin screening. Missing metrics remain REVIEW rather than silently passing.
- **Convergence / cost** — observed two-level convergence order plus a computational-cost-versus-error non-dominated frontier.
- **Replicate robustness** — finite seed/chain/timestep/repeat summaries with mean, sample standard deviation, coefficient of variation, p05/median/p95, range and extrema.

The shipped thresholds are transparent starting defaults and are editable. They are **not standards or certification limits**.

### Numerical Error → accuracy & precision engineering

The Numerical Error profile turns floating-point studies into an accuracy/cost design problem. The default scorecard considers:

- worst normalized numerical error;
- scan pass fraction;
- observed convergence order.

The cost/accuracy view can compare float32/float64, raw/range-reduced algorithms, Taylor order, reference precision or scan density. A small final Taylor term is not treated as proof that the final answer is accurate; independent/high-precision reference comparison remains decisive.

### Ising Monte Carlo → sampling & criticality engineering

The Ising profile uses the Lab's existing statistical diagnostics rather than counting raw sweeps as if they were independent samples. Its default scorecard considers:

- worst multi-chain R-hat;
- minimum effective sample size;
- exact/reference relative discrepancy when a reference exists;
- equilibration drift in sigma units.

This makes autocorrelation, ESS, equilibration, finite-size behavior and computational work part of the engineering decision.

### Random Walk / Monte Carlo → estimator engineering

The stochastic profile focuses on whether the estimator behaves as expected and whether additional computational work actually buys precision. The default scorecard considers:

- MSD/diffusion scaling-exponent error relative to the target theory used by the study;
- estimator relative error;
- finite-replicate coefficient of variation.

It can compare ordinary Monte Carlo, different sample counts/seeds and scrambled-QMC designs on a shared cost↔error plane without claiming universal superiority from one finite benchmark.

### Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos → robust classification engineering

For chaotic systems, requiring long-time trajectories to remain pointwise identical is usually physically inappropriate. The Chaos profile instead defaults to:

- timestep sensitivity of a selected finite-window indicator;
- finite-replicate spread of a Lyapunov statistic;
- relative energy/work-balance error where such a balance is meaningful.

Engineering requirements should preferentially target Lyapunov estimates, Poincaré/event statistics, bifurcation/flip locations, invariants or other finite-window observables—not raw long-time coordinate agreement.

### Oscillation / Integration → dynamic-system engineering

The Oscillation profile maps solver outputs naturally to mechanical/control-style response requirements:

- frequency relative error;
- amplitude relative error;
- phase error;
- energy/work-balance relative error;
- response change under timestep refinement.

These are useful computational engineering quantities, but real apparatus validation still requires measurements, calibration, and model-form uncertainty evidence.

See [`docs/MULTI_LAB_ENGINEERING_V081.md`](docs/MULTI_LAB_ENGINEERING_V081.md).

## v0.8.0 — shared Engineering Design Workflow

The model-specific profiles sit on top of the common v0.8 engineering foundation rather than replacing it.

### Requirement-driven verification

Named response metrics can be checked against lower and/or upper limits with an explicitly entered symmetric uncertainty interval:

- **PASS** — the full entered interval stays inside the requirement;
- **REVIEW** — nominal is inside, but the entered interval crosses a limit;
- **FAIL** — nominal itself violates a limit.

These are engineering-screening labels, not certification claims.

### Sensitivity, optimization and robust design

Physical Lab supports one-at-a-time finite-difference sensitivity ranking, explicit min/max Pareto non-dominated screening, and finite solver/manufacturing ensemble summaries with mean, sample standard deviation, min/max and p05/median/p95. Finite-sample pass fractions are descriptive screening results, not automatically manufacturing yield or certified probabilities of failure.

### Measured-field validation

Co-registered field series can be compared using MAE, RMSE, maximum residual, model-relative RMSE, field-integral difference and uncertainty-normalized residual statistics when pointwise uncertainty is actually supplied. The workflow does not infer missing uncertainty assumptions or label the normalized statistic as chi-square without the needed statistical assumptions.

### Calibration, lightweight multiphysics and batch planning

A bounded model-based update can calculate a next parameter from response error and local sensitivity, but performs **no hardware I/O**. A first-order undulator thermal screen propagates expansion/field-temperature effects into `K` and resonance energy, explicitly without pretending to be structural/thermal FEA. Deterministic case fingerprints, resumable chunks and scheduling-wave estimates provide a batch/HPC boundary without blindly parallelizing native solvers.

See [`docs/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_V080.md`](docs/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_V080.md).

## Representative deep path: accelerator physics

```text
Engineering requirement
        ↓
Undulator / magnet geometry
        ↓
RADIA Magnet Studio (Full mode)
        ↓
realized B(x,y,z), harmonics, field integrals, manufacturing-error ensemble
        ↓
measured-field comparison / residual
        ↓
electron trajectory / phase behavior
        ↓
Radiation Platform
        ↓
resonance / spectrum-oriented analysis
        ↓
analytic reference + requirement margin + design decision
```

Safe mode keeps a clearly labeled analytical ideal-undulator fallback available when RADIA is unavailable; it is not presented as a replacement for 3-D magnetic-field solving.

## Research workspace and reproducibility

A `.physlab` project owns structured datasets, measurements, runs, figures, exports, provenance, pipelines and campaigns. Runs preserve model parameters, execution mode, source revision, Python/package state and results so they can be compared and reproduced.

### Measurement bridge

Physical Lab preserves CSV, TSV, JSON and HDF5 measurements with quantity, unit, sensor, calibration notes, timestamp and SHA-256 provenance. The native macOS build can discover `/dev/cu.*` / `/dev/tty.*` serial devices and perform bounded numeric capture for Arduino-style sensors. This is data acquisition, not arbitrary device control or firmware flashing.

### Integrity Center

Dependency presence and scientific readiness are deliberately separate. Requirement compatibility is checked inside each Lab's `.venv`; global packages do not make a Lab green; repair targets only the selected managed environment; and scientific smoke tests perform small calculations rather than stopping at import success.

### Run Vault and exports

The advanced experiment layer preserves parameter fingerprints, package versions, source revision and bounded result snapshots. v0.9 campaign results additionally preserve their resolved preset/configuration and deterministic campaign fingerprint. Reproducibility exports package project state with machine/runtime information and per-Lab package freezes. See [`docs/RESEARCH_WORKSPACE.md`](docs/RESEARCH_WORKSPACE.md).

## Measurement Digital Twin

Physical Lab contains a shared **measurement → calibration → model → comparison → update** core for linear sensor calibration, measured/model field residuals and field integrals, affine discrepancy fitting, transverse beam phase-space/RMS-emittance statistics, and residual-guided remeasurement priorities.

For RADIA Magnet Studio Full mode, the RADIA Measurement Adapter evaluates the current managed magnet model at explicit measurement coordinates and can run a bounded one-parameter profile over `gap_mm`, `br_t`, or `z_offset_mm`. The best finite-grid result is not presented as a global optimum or posterior distribution.

The same mathematical definitions are exposed through `scripts/physical_lab_digital_twin_cli.py`. See [`docs/DIGITAL_TWIN_CORE.md`](docs/DIGITAL_TWIN_CORE.md).

## Optional Local AI Assistant

Physical Lab can use a **local-only, read-only explanation layer** through OpenPenguin/Ollama-compatible localhost services. It receives a bounded structured snapshot and can explain parameters, units, assumptions, diagnostics and possible experiments. It cannot modify Lab parameters, download models, execute model-generated code or contact a cloud endpoint. The scientific workbench remains fully functional without a local model.

## Validation and CI

### Deterministic source validation

Source Integrity validates syntax, manifests, release-version coherence and deterministic numerical/reference behavior. Current reference evidence includes numerical-error behavior, oscillator integration, random-walk MSD, exact 2-D Ising critical temperature, ideal-undulator resonance, the Measurement Digital Twin core, the accelerator resonance benchmark, the v0.8 Engineering Design Workflow, the v0.8.1 five-profile model-engineering layer, and the v0.9 automated five-model campaigns.

`docs/model-engineering-reference-validation.json` and `scripts/model_engineering_reference_validation.py --check` cover all five non-accelerator scorecards plus convergence-order math, finite-replicate statistics, symmetric relative change and cost/error non-dominated filtering.

`scripts/model_campaign_reference_validation.py` actually executes all five Compact campaigns, routes their canonical metrics through the same engineering scorecards used by the UI, and requires every profile to PASS with 100% metric completeness. It additionally exercises the Standard nonlinear-chaos preset because finite-time chaotic diagnostics are especially sensitive to an inappropriate observation window.

### Native Full-mode acceptance

`.github/workflows/full-mode-acceptance.yml` runs separately on clean macOS, builds a pinned RADIA Universal2 revision, verifies `arm64 + x86_64`, evaluates a real native field, exercises the pinned Radiation Platform field-map path, reruns reference cores and uploads JSON evidence.

For the simple planar reference `B0 = 0.05 T`, `lambda_u = 20 mm`, `gamma = 80`, the accelerator benchmark requires field-map-derived frequency and photon energy to agree with closed form within a declared `5e-4` relative-error bound and verifies `E = h f` consistency.

Full-mode CI also creates a deterministic **synthetic measurement-like** perturbed field map, propagates nominal and perturbed fields through Radiation Platform, and records field residuals plus changes in frequency, photon energy and transverse excursion. This proves the software path **field discrepancy → trajectory/radiation discrepancy**; it is not a real magnet measurement.

## Validation philosophy

Physical Lab follows a simple rule: **a simulation result is not automatically a physical result**.

The project distinguishes:

- numerical convergence from physical validity;
- automated campaign PASS from experimental validation or certification;
- editable engineering screening thresholds from external standards or certification;
- finite seed/chain/ensemble statistics from population failure probabilities or manufacturing yield;
- finite Ising lattices from the thermodynamic limit;
- finite stochastic benchmarks from universal estimator superiority;
- finite-time chaos indicators from global trajectory claims;
- chaotic trajectory divergence from numerical failure;
- analytical Safe-mode references from RADIA Full-mode field solutions;
- synthetic measurement-like CI fixtures from real experiments;
- Pareto non-dominance from proof of global optimality;
- optional runtimes from engines actually consumed by a validated Lab.

See [`docs/VALIDATION.md`](docs/VALIDATION.md).

## What Physical Lab contributes

Physical Lab does **not** claim that every upstream scientific engine was authored here. Its contribution boundary has three layers:

1. **Original physics projects and analysis layers** — seven linked Lab repositories plus Physical Lab's advanced experiment, V&V/UQ, digital-twin, automated campaign and engineering-decision layers.
2. **Research-software engineering** — Tauri/Rust macOS shell, Module/Runtime/Dependency/Task/Integrity centers, isolated environments, Safe/Full policy, source pinning, ABI/runtime discovery, scientific smoke tests, cancellation, workspaces, provenance and reproducibility export.
3. **Third-party scientific engines** — RADIA, Project Chrono/Chrono::Modal and VAMPIRE retain their own authorship/licenses. RADIA is currently consumed by real Labs; Chrono::Modal and VAMPIRE remain optional adapter boundaries rather than advertised active solvers.

See [`docs/ORIGINAL_CONTRIBUTIONS.md`](docs/ORIGINAL_CONTRIBUTIONS.md).

## Build on macOS

```bash
chmod +x RUN_SOURCE_SELF_CHECK.command BUILD_PHYSICAL_LAB.command
./RUN_SOURCE_SELF_CHECK.command
./BUILD_PHYSICAL_LAB.command
```

The release builder targets a Universal2 macOS application (`arm64` + `x86_64`). Release metadata is anchored by `VERSION` and checked against `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, README and CHANGELOG. CI derives artifact names from the canonical version.

A packaged public DMG should still be treated separately from source correctness; Developer ID signing and notarization must be validated on the exact public release artifact.

## Current scope

- Native macOS desktop application built with Tauri 2 / Rust.
- Seven computational-physics Labs.
- Shared Engineering V&V/UQ and Engineering Design Workflow.
- Five domain-specific non-accelerator engineering profiles from v0.8.1.
- Five one-click automated non-accelerator engineering campaigns in v0.9.0.
- RADIA is the only fragile native physics engine currently consumed by a real Lab.
- Chrono::Modal and VAMPIRE remain optional future adapter boundaries.
- The old `radiaition-study` / Radiation Study project is intentionally excluded.
