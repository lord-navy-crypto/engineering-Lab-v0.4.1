"""Mount the shared .physlab Project surface after every managed Lab UI.

The individual upstream Labs remain unchanged. This wrapper extends Physical
Lab's shared advanced renderer so all ten managed Lab profiles expose the same
canonical Project Kernel; the Evidence Center patch then extends that Project
Kernel. During the compatibility period it also performs one non-destructive
legacy desktop-workspace sync per Streamlit session when session state is
available.
