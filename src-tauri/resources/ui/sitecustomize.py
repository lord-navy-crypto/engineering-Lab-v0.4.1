"""Physical Lab startup UI hooks.

The original shared Streamlit enhancement layer is preserved byte-for-byte in
physical_lab_sitecustomize_base. Python project browsers are patched to discover
canonical ``projects/*.physlab`` directly; compatibility aliases are therefore
no longer a prerequisite for the shared Lab UI. The Evidence Center, Project
surface, and native desktop deep-link entry remain installed for every managed Lab.
